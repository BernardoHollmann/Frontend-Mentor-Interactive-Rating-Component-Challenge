  - The challenge consisted in replicating an interactive card rating component for a desktop and mobile view perspective. The user should be abble to select and submit a number rating, see the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating and see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript;
  - This challange was really difficult for me, specially the Javascript part. I had a really hard time trying to understand how to select the elements on the page and using its attributes. I felt really frustrated and I had to look for the solution on the youtube channel (thanks to user tsbsankara for sharing it on youtube).
  - The structuring and stylishing part of the challange was not so difficult. Of course, the alignment and the round part of the rating numbers took me sometime to figureout how to implement, but I could solve it after some time and trying. However, I got stucked for some days in the Javascript part. I start styding programming for sometime and this project showed me that, if you don't regullary practice programming, you WILL forget what you learned. For instance, I knew I had to select the rating buttons somehow and get the innertText or innerHTML values to use for the next cart (tku-container), but OH BOY, I tried and tried some approaches and, after seeing that a simply forEach would do it, got me really frustrated.
